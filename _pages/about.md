Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in the College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS) at Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)), supervised by [Prof. Jie Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/zhangj/) and [Prof. Zhiguang Cao](https://zhiguangcaosg.github.io/). Before that, I received my M.Eng. degree from Sun Yat-Sen University ([SYSU](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/)) in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Jiahai Wang](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Jiahai-Wang/2815388) and my B.Sc. degree from SYSU in 2020.

Research
======
My research interests focus on the intersection of Machine Learning (ML) and Optimization, striving to develop automated ML solutions to address complex optimization and decision-making challenges. Recently, I have been working on advancing neural combinatorial optimization solvers to address practical challenges
