Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the College of Computing and Data Science ([CCDS](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing)) at Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)), supervised by [Prof. Jie Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/zhangj/) and [Prof. Zhiguang Cao](https://zhiguangcaosg.github.io/). Before that, I received my M.Eng. degree from Sun Yat-Sen University ([SYSU](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/)) in 2023, advised by [Prof. Jiahai Wang](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Jiahai-Wang/2815388) and [Prof. Zizhen Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Qzxm58oAAAAJ&hl=en), and received my B.Sc. degree from SYSU in 2020, advised by [Prof. Yuanyan Xiong](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuanyan-Xiong), [Prof. Zhiming Dai](https://www.aminer.cn/profile/zhiming-dai/53f45a8cdabfaee4dc822172) and [Dr. Mengbiao Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F8p_MxEAAAAJ&hl=en).

Research
======
My research interests focus on the intersection of Machine Learning (ML) and Optimization, striving to develop automated ML solutions to address complex optimization problems and decision-making challenges. Recently, I have been working on advancing neural combinatorial optimization solvers to address practical challenges, especially for vehicle routing problems.
